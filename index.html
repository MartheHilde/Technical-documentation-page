<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.</p>
<p>The initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and raised unanswered questions, causing implementations to both intentionally and accidentally diverge from the original version. This was addressed in 2014, when long-standing Markdown contributors released CommonMark, an unambiguous specification and test suite for Markdown.</p></section>
<p>What you will learn:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some facts about Markdown and it's history</li>
    <li>Some of the fundamentals of Markdown</li>

    <header>What you should already know</header>
<p>You should know that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>As Markdown's popularity grew rapidly, many Markdown implementations appeared, driven mostly by the need for additional features such as tables, footnotes, definition lists, and Markdown inside HTML blocks.</li>
    <li>The behavior of some of these diverged from the reference implementation, as Markdown was only characterised by an informal specification[14] and a Perl implementation for conversion to HTML.</li>
    <li>At the same time, a number of ambiguities in the informal specification had attracted attention. These issues spurred the creation of tools such as Babelmark to compare the output of various implementations, and an effort by some developers of Markdown parsers for standardisation. However, Gruber has argued that complete standardization would be a mistake: "Different sites (and people) have different needs. No one syntax would make all happy." And this is all Wikipedia copypasta.</li>
</ul>

<p>In light of an ever-growing text editor market, we are constantly thinking of ways to make UltraEdit better. Our most recent release, which includes the oft-requested Markdown support, is one product of those efforts. So as of v25.20, UltraEdit includes full support for Markdown highlighting, editing, and previewing!</p></section>

<p>Those of you who are already familiar with Markdown will understand why this is so exciting. But there are others among you who have heard of Markdown but have never used it, or who haven’t heard of it at all! So we wanted to talk about some of the reasons why Markdown is so great.</p>

<p>It’s possible you’ve encountered Markdown without realizing it. Facebook chat, Skype, and Reddit all let you use different flavors of Markdown to format your messages.</p></section>

    <header>Main usage</header>
<p>Markdown is dead simple to learn. The official syntax can be found here, but most of what you’ll need to know is that typing *word* will make it bold, typing **word** or _word_ will italicize the word, links are written like this [anchor text](http://www.URL.com), and lists are written exactly how you’d expect: just hit enter and add any of these three characters at the start of each line: -, *, +. So this:</p>
<p>So typing Markdown is almost always faster than writing with a rich text editor, especially when you start getting into things like links or bulleted lists, which either make you use the mouse or force you to memorize a complicated sequence of keyboard shortcuts. One caveat is that if you need complicated text elements, such as tables, you’re better off sticking to HTML. Fortunately, Markdown has full HTML support, so you can code a table in HTML and go right back to Markdown in the same document.</p></section>

<p>Markdown converts to HTML flawlessly, sparing you the hassle of opening and closing all those tags. So. Many. Tags.</p>
<p>In fact, Markdown has the software to convert the plain text to HTML built in! So Markdown is actually a text-to-HTML conversion software in addition to being a markup language.</p>
